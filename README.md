# S&P Sectors Holding Period Investment Analysis

## Project Description: 
This project is a deep-dive statistical analysis focusing on performance of the S&P 500 (eleven individual sectors and the sector considered as a whole) beginning with year 2000. Two short-term holding periods for each sector over the multi-year time span were analyzed to determine if (1) the group as a whole or (2) any individual sector  delivered statistically higher returns.   

Holding Period (A): Weekend Hug - Buy the Thursday 4pm Close and Sell the following Monday 4pm Close

Holding Period (B): Mid-Week - Buy the Monday 4pm Close and Sell the following Thursday 4pm Close




## Data: 
The stock tickers for the sectors are from http://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/. The datasets are from https://finance.yahoo.com/. Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook were utilized to work with the data and arrive at definitive conclusions for both hypotheses. Morevover, considerations were made for data smear and distribution properties to pick the appropriate test to compare the samples.





## Conclusions:
